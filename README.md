### ECS 171: Machine Learning (Group 9)

# Analysis on the Particle Collider Dataset

# Abstract
We have two datasets, `Output_File_2023_02_15.root` which includes data about the linear collisions and `yieldHistos_7p7GeV_Pion_2022_08_31.root` which contains data about circular. The project idea is to analyze the datasets on the shape of explosions from a particle collider in order to determine what aspects of the particles used and conditions are common between collider and detector types. These findings would be significant because they can help researchers determine the collider type they should use when looking to collide heavy ion particles. We are not fully certain on what machine learning model we will use, but are considering unsupervised learning by applying a Convolutional neural network (CNN) to the data to identify correlations and connections between data points. 

# Description of Data
We compiled the relevant columns from both the linear collisions dataset and circular collisions dataset into a mutable dataframe. Although this dataframe appears to only have 2 rows, contained within those rows contain are 1000x1000 matrices representing data from over 91,000 collisions. This way of packaging the data allows physicists to work with larger quantities of data then would be compatible with a csv file. The original .root files had over 200 different features, but the the features that we choose to include in our dataframe and thus to analyse were dEdx_PionPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_PionMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_KaonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_KaonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_ProtonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_ProtonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_DeuteronPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_DeuteronMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_TritonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_TritonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_HelionPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_HelionMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_AlphaPlus_Isolated;1, and dEdx_AlphaMinus_Isolated;1. We decided to use these datapoints because each feature isolates stopping power data per composite particle and these features coincide in both files.

# Data Preprocessing 
### Aug. 25th
Our next step in our data preprocessing is to compress the size of our matrices by removing excess zeros from both ends of the distributions and zoning in on the larger numerical values. We will also indentify the peak values in the gaussian distributions contrast the deviations with the ideal gaussian. 

### Sept. 1st
While the next step in our preprocessing plan involved making our matrices dense (i.e. "zooming into meaningful
data") for the purpose of making our neural net run faster, we instead decided to go with an alternative approach.
From our last milestone, we were able to extract 14 1000x1000 matrices such that: 
1. rows correspond to position
1. columns correspond to change in energy over distance (equates to Stopping power)
1. values correspond to the number of decayed particles that were detected at that Stopping Power and Position ) 

As we have now developed a better understanding of what the matrices represent, we believe it is more beneficial
for us to convert these matrices into tabular data form as it is something we are all more familiar and comfortable
working with. However, for the final project, we entend to use a convolutional neural network on the matrices in addition to the model we uilt this week

Before creating this `.csv` file, we first one-hot encoded our `linear` and `circular` features. After doing so, we  then
actually began the process of creating the dataframe columns (i.e. converting the matrices), which consisted of the positions,
stopping power, the detection number for different particle types, and the one hot encoded columns representing circular and linear collider types. This process involved the challenge of trying to extract only the most useful parts of each matrix so that the size did not get too overwhelmingly large, while still keeping the rows and columns between matrices exactly the same indexes so that we could merge them into a dataframe smoothly based on the position and stopping power columns. 

After each matrix was converted into a tabular dataform, we then merged each of them into a single tabular dataframe, after
which we normalized all features before beginning training and testing of our model. We normalized the circular data and the linear data seperately because the circular data on average had many more detections then linear, and we did not want this to bias our model. The circular data came from a differenrt root file where its likely more events were run, causing the circular data to have higher counts. A model that trained on this data would not have generalized to the real world, so we scaled all columns seperately for circular and linear collider types. 

# Descriptions of Graphs 
The y axis on our plots represents stopping power per particle. The x axis represents mass energy of a particle. We decided to leave the y axis inverted when graphing in order to make the y axis stand out more from the x axis to help with our analysis. Some interesting trends we noticed on these graphs were a small variance along the axis for pions and deuteron and proton minus distributions and logarithmic correlations with other distributions.

# Description and Evaluation of First Model
### Description
In hopes of predicting the type of collider, either circular or linear, we use a 4-layers ANN to predict the type that we one-hot encoded during our pre-processing phrase. This feed forward neural net base on the selected features of the particles to classify.
* Given that we have large amounts of datapoints in our HolyGrail.csv, we use Relu activation functions for efficent runtime. We also use Sigmoid activation function to classify the 2 groups, and use Binary Logarithmic Loss function to update our model weights and bias. We split our dataset into 90:10 of propotion, with linear and circular columns as our target and every other columns as our features.
* We check the MSE and accurary_score for performance, as well as illustrating the classification report on our result.

### Evaluation
In our project, using a 4-layer ANN to process complex data is a reasonable choice. The Relu activation function can speed up training because it does not involve exponential operations, while the Sigmoid activation function is suitable for classification problems. It is also appropriate to use a sigmoid output layer for binary classification. Choosing an appropriate activation function and number of network layers can improve the performance of the model.
* Data Preprocessing: In the data preprocessing stage, the types are one-hot encoded, which is a common practice for multi-class classification problems. It is also standard practice to split the dataset into 90:10 train and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
* Performance Metrics: This experiment evaluates the performance of the model using mean squared error (MSE) and accuracy. These two metrics provide important information about the performance of the model on the training and test data. MSE is used to measure the prediction error of continuous output, while accuracy (Accuracy) is used to evaluate the performance of classification models. The use of these two metrics is appropriate because they provide different aspects of performance information.
* Classification Report: Generating a classification report is mentioned, which is a good practice. Classification reports usually include indicators such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., which are very helpful for understanding the performance of the model on each category. This can help determine if the model is performing better or worse on certain categories.
* Tuning and Improvement: While some descriptions of the model are provided, no hyperparameter tuning or other steps for further improvement are mentioned in the lab report. In practical applications, multiple trials and adjustments are usually required to optimize model performance.
* For the four cross-validation folds (Folds), the MSE of each fold is very close, all around 0.018.
The average MSE value is 0.018, which means that the average prediction error of the model is relatively small. MSE measures the difference between the predicted value of the model and the actual value, and a smaller MSE indicates a better predictive performance of the model.
* R2 Score Analysis:
For the four cross-validation folds, the R2 scores for each fold range from 0.413 to 0.416.
The average R2 score is 0.414, which is lower than expected. We intend to investigate this issue furthure in the final project
* Overall average MSE and R2:
The overall mean MSE was 0.018 and the overall mean R2 was 0.414. This shows that the performance of the model on the entire data set is also stable, and the fitting effect on the data is better.
* Collapse of best MSE and R2 scores:
First-fold cross-validation achieves the best performance in terms of MSE and R2. This means that at this compromise, the model has the smallest prediction error and the best fit to the data.
* Overall, this project appears to be a reasonable modeling of a classification problem, using an appropriate neural network architecture and performance evaluation metrics. However, more detailed information, such as the choice of hyperparameters and the results of the training process, as well as a broader model performance report, would provide a more complete understanding of the quality of experiments and model performance

# Challenges
### Data Exploration
The biggest challenge we came across with this Data Exploration milestone was figuring out how to extract the data from the two `.root` files we are working with. Initially, the plan was to convert these `.root` files into `.csv` files outside of Colab by first converting them into a dictionary and then a pandas dataframe and finally saving as a `.csv`, and then import the `.csv` files into Colab and work with those. However, for some reason, the `.csv` file conversion process was causing us to loose important data, so we decided to directly work with the `.root` files in Colab. We were able to copy and paste our old code which converted these `.root` files into a dictionary and then a pandas dataframe. Figuring out how to work with `.root` files without installing root in general was another challenge.

### Preprocessing and First Model Building and Evaluation
The biggest challenge was figuring how to convert 26 1000x1000 matrices into a nice readable dataframe. We had to decide how we wanted to represent this data in our dataframe, and once we decided that we wanted to merge all the particles from different matrices into the same rows based on stopping power and position, it became a big issue to try to make sure that we are extracting the data at the exact same places in the matrices for all features, and that the places we are extracting data would contain the least amount of useless data (all zeros would be considered useless). 
In retrospect, it would have been easier to do this based on looking at areas across all graphs where nost data seemed to be concentrated. However, the approach we choose involved interating through matrices to find the maximum and minimum row and column where there is meaningful data, using those values to find the global minimum and maximum, evaluating at those points and creating a dataframe for each feature, recursively merging all dataframes into one, and then normalizing and removing noise and all rows of all 0s
