### ECS 171: Machine Learning (Group 9)

# Analysis on the Particle Collider Dataset

# Abstract
We have two datasets, `Output_File_2023_02_15.root` which includes data about the linear collisions and `yieldHistos_7p7GeV_Pion_2022_08_31.root` which contains data about circular. The project idea is to analyze the datasets on the shape of explosions from a particle collider in order to determine what aspects of the particles used and conditions are common between collider and detector types. These findings would be significant because they can help researchers determine the collider type they should use when looking to collide heavy ion particles. We are not fully certain on what machine learning model we will use, but are considering unsupervised learning by applying a Convolutional neural network (CNN) to the data to identify correlations and connections between data points. 

# Description of Data
We compiled the relevant columns from both the linear collisions dataset and circular collisions dataset into a mutable dataframe. Although this dataframe appears to only have 2 rows, contained within those rows contain are 1000x1000 matrices representing data from over 91,000 collisions. This way of packaging the data allows physicists to work with larger quantities of data then would be compatible with a csv file. The original .root files had over 200 different features, but the the features that we choose to include in our dataframe and thus to analyse were dEdx_PionPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_PionMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_KaonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_KaonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_ProtonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_ProtonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_DeuteronPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_DeuteronMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_TritonPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_TritonMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_HelionPlus_Isolated;1, dEdx_HelionMinus_Isolated;1, dEdx_AlphaPlus_Isolated;1, and dEdx_AlphaMinus_Isolated;1. We decided to use these datapoints because each feature isolates stopping power data per composite particle and these features coincide in both files.

# Data Preprocessing 
### Aug. 25th
Our next step in our data preprocessing is to compress the size of our matrices by removing excess zeros from both ends of the distributions and zoning in on the larger numerical values. We will also indentify the peak values in the gaussian distributions contrast the deviations with the ideal gaussian. 

### Sept. 1st
While the next step in our preprocessing plan involved making our matrices dense (i.e. "zooming into meaningful
data") for the purpose of making our neural net run faster, we instead decided to go with an alternative approach.
From our last milestone, we were able to extract 14 1000x1000 matrices. Through further analysis of the data stored
in these matrices, we were able to deduce the following: 
1. rows correspond to position
1. columns correspond to change in energy over distance (equates to Stopping power)
1. values correspond to the number of collisions (more specifically, the number of decayed particles that were detected at that Stopping Power and Position ) 

As we have now developed a better understanding of what the matrices represent, we believe it is more beneficial
for us to convert these matrices into tabular data form as it is something we are all more familiar and comfortable
working with. 

Before creating this `.csv` file, we first one-hot encoded our `linear` and `circular` features. After doing so, we  then
actually began the process of creating the dataframe columns (i.e. converting the matrices), which consisted of the positions,
stopping power, and all other features as being their own separate columns. This process involved the challenge of shrinking our
large dataset (115,000 data points) by finding a range of data in each matrix where a large amount of non-zero values would be completed
removed without removing entire rows from the dataframe (to preserve shape of each matrix turned dataframe and to avoid concatenation conflicts).

After each matrix was converted into a tabular dataform, we then merged each of them into a single tabular dataframe, after
which we normalized all features before beginning training and testing of our model.

# Descriptions of Graphs 
Thee y axis on our plots represents stopping power per particle. The x axis represents mass energy of a particle. We decided to leave the y axis inverted when graphing in order to make the y axis stand out more from the x axis to help with our analysis. Some interesting trends we noticed on these graphs were a small variance along the axis for pions and deuteron and proton minus distributions and logarithmic correlations with other distributions.

# Description and Evaluation of First Model
### Description
In hopes of predicting the type of collider, either circular or linear, we use a 4-layers ANN to predict the type that we one-hot encoded during our pre-processing phrase. This feed forward neural net base on the selected features of the particles to classify.
* Given that we have large amounts of datapoints in our HolyGrail.csv, we use Relu activation functions for efficent runtime. We also use Sigmoid activation function to classify the 2 groups, and use Binary Logarithmic Loss function to update our model weights and bias. We split our dataset into 90:10 of propotion, with linear and circular columns as our target and every other columns as our features.
* We check the MSE and accurary_score for performance, as well as illustrating the classification report on our result.

# Challenges
### Data Exploration
The biggest challenge we came across with this Data Exploration milestone was figuring out how to extract the data from the two `.root` files we are working with. Initially, the plan was to convert these `.root` files into `.csv` files outside of Colab by first converting them into a dictionary and then a pandas dataframe and finally saving as a `.csv`, and then import the `.csv` files into Colab and work with those. However, for some reason, the `.csv` file conversion process was causing us to loose important data, so we decided to directly work with the `.root` files in Colab. We were able to copy and paste our old code which converted these `.root` files into a dictionary and then a pandas dataframe. Figuring out how to work with `.root` files without installing root in general was another challenge.
